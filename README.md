### üî≠ My Projects

These are the projects I've built to practice my skills.

**1. PetAlert (IoT Safety Device)**
* **Problem:** To prevent injuries to animals that take shelter under stationary vehicles by alerting them before the vehicle starts.
* **Solution:** An IoT-based, multi-stage alert and deterrent system. It uses a piezo sensor to detect the vehicle starting, triggers a buzzer, checks for presence with a PIR sensor, and activates a water-spraying motor to safely encourage the animal to move. The driver receives real-time status updates via an ESP32 captive Wi-Fi portal.
* **Tech:** ESP32, Arduino, C++, Piezo Sensor, PIR Sensor.

**2. Student CRUD (Hibernate)**
* A full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application for managing student records.
* **Tech:** Java, Hibernate (ORM), PostgreSQL, Maven.
* *[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Revathireddyb7/MyHibernateProject.git)*

**3. Student CRUD (JDBC)**
* My first implementation of a CRUD application using raw JDBC, including data analysis features (e.g., average age, students per branch).
* **Tech:** Java, JDBC, PostgreSQL.
* *[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Revathireddyb7/JDBC_StudentCRUDApp.git)*

**4. Website Clones (HTML/CSS)**
* A collection of static website clones to practice frontend skills.
* **Tech:** HTML5, CSS3.
* *[Link to Repository](https://github.com/Revathireddyb7/basic-projects.git)*
* *[Link to Demo Videos](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-MNHFFiLRjwPccs0-DIKKiUyzxxblDwR?usp=sharing)*
